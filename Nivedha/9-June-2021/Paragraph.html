    <h3>Sun</h3>
	
	<p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly 
	perfect sphere of hot plasma,[18][19] heated to incandescence by nuclear 
	fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy mainly as visible light
	and infrared radiation. It is by far the most important source of energy for
	life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles)
	or 109 times that of Earth.</p>
	
	<h3>Planet</h3>
	<p>A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant
	that is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive 
	enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and – according to the International 
	Astronomical Union but not all planetary scientists – has cleared its
	neighbouring region of planetesimals.</p>
	
	<h3>Fire</h3>
	<p>Fire is the rapid oxidation of a material in the exothermic chemical process
	of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products.
	Fire is hot because the conversion of the weak double bond in molecular 
	oxygen, O2, to the stronger bonds in the combustion products carbon dioxide
	and water releases energy (418 kJ per 32 g of O2); the bond energies of the 
	fuel play only a minor role here.</p>
	
	<h3>River</h3>
	
	<p>A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing 
	towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases, a river flows 
	into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching 
	another body of water. </p>
	
	<h3>Animals</h3>
	
	<p>Animals(also called Metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that
	form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume 
	organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, 
	and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic 
	development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of 
	which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 
	7 million animal species in total.</p>
